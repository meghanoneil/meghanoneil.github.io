<h1>History of Plastic Production

    <p>
<h3>Plastic is a word that originally meant “pliable and easily shaped.” It only recently became a name for a category of materials called polymers. The word polymer means “of many parts,” and polymers are made of long chains of molecules. Polymers are abundent in nature. Cellulose, the material that makes up the cell walls of plants, is a very common natural polymer.
       <p>
Over the last century and a half humans have learned how to make synthetic polymers, sometimes using natural substances like cellulose, but more often using the plentiful carbon atoms provided by petroleum and other fossil fuels.
It is the length of these chains, and the patterns in which they are arrayed, that make polymers strong, lightweight, and flexible. In other words, it’s what makes them so plastic.
        <p>
These properties make synthetic polymers exceptionally useful, and since we learned how to create and manipulate them, polymers have become an essential part of our lives. Especially over the last 50 years plastics have saturated our world and changed the way that we live.

<h2>Aluminum and Metal Recycling
<h3>Aluminum cans, aluminum foil and bakeware, and steel or tin cans (ie: soup cans, canned veggies, etc.) are all metals that can be processed by many recycling systems. Double-check with your local recycling service that these items don’t need to be sorted separately from other recyclables, but often, they can go straight in the recycling bin. Remember to rinse recycable items prior to putting them into a recycaling bin, this prevents odor or insect issues.
